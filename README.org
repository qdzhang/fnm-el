* Fnm-el

Fnm-el integrate Emacs with [[https://github.com/Schniz/fnm][fnm]] to manage Node.js versions.

** Fnm-el does...

- Setup the =PATH= environment variable.
- Setup ~exec-path~ to contains Node.js =bin/= directories.

So it will be easy to adapt this package to many other versions management tools.

** Installation

Install fnm separately and install some Node.js versions managed by fnm.

Then put this package in your load-path and  require it:

#+begin_src  elisp
(require 'fnm)
#+end_src

** Usage

The only function  is ~(fnm-set)~ . It will:

- Determine whether there is a =.node-version= or =.nvmrc= in the root of
  project. If so, use the Node.js version specified by these files.
- Use a version from user input.
- Use the system default Node.js version.
